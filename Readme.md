# Terran Republic Interstellar Plotter System

## Introduction

TRIPS (Terran Interstellar Plotter System) is a JavaFX-based 3D stellar cartography application for visualizing and plotting interstellar routes. It combines Spring Boot for backend services with JavaFX for 3D visualization, using an embedded H2 database for persistence.

Origins: Initially developed with Chuck Gannon to help visualize the stellar neighborhood for his Caine Riordan series. See [charlesegannon.com](https://charlesegannon.com).

**Key capabilities:**
- View and edit stellar data in tabular form
- Plot stars in an interactive 3D visualization
- Plan interstellar routes using graph algorithms
- Explore solar systems with orbital visualization
- Generate procedural planets with realistic terrain
- Import data from major astronomical catalogs (Gaia, SIMBAD, VizieR)
- Use for scientific research or science fiction world-building
