     * In astronomy, the argument of periapsis (ω) is a way of talking about the orbit of a planet, asteroid or
     * comet. It is also known as the argument of perihelion or the argument of perifocus. It is the angle
     * (starting from the center of the orbit) between an orbiting body's periapsis and its ascending node.
     * Periapsis is the point when the orbiting object comes the closest to the thing it is orbiting around;
     * for example, the moon is at periapsis when it is closest to the Earth. The ascending node is one of
     * two places where an orbiting object passes through the reference plane, an imaginary flat surface which
     * runs through the object being orbited around. The size of the angle depends on which way the object is
     * orbiting.
     * <p>
     * The angle is measured in the orbital plane and in the direction of motion. For specific types of orbits,
     * words such as "perihelion" (for Sun-centered orbits), "perigee" (for Earth-centered orbits), "pericenter"
     * (general), etc. may replace the word "periapsis".
     * <p>
     * An argument of periapsis of 0° means that the orbiting body will be at its closest approach to the central
     * body at the same moment that it crosses the plane of reference from south to north. An argument of
     * periapsis of 90° means that the orbiting body will reach periapsis at its northmost distance from the
     * plane of reference.
