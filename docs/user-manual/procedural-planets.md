# Procedural Planets

TRIPS can generate procedural planets with configurable terrain and climate models.

## Generate a Planet

1. Open the planet generation tools from the Solar System view.
2. Choose generation settings (seed, plate count, climate model).
3. Run the generator and review the results.

## Tips

- Use a fixed seed to reproduce a planet later.
- Increase plate counts for more complex terrain.
