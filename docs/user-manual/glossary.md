# Glossary

## A

- **ACCRETE**: Procedural model for generating planetary systems based on stellar properties.
- **Active Dataset**: See *Context*.
- **AU (Astronomical Unit)**: The average distance from Earth to the Sun, approximately 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers. Used for measuring distances within solar systems.

## C

- **Context**: The currently selected dataset that TRIPS uses for all operations (searching, plotting, routing). Only one dataset can be active at a time. Set via **File → Open Dataset...** or the side panel.
- **CSV Import**: The primary method for importing star data into TRIPS using comma-separated value files.

## D

- **Dataset**: A catalog of stars loaded into TRIPS for visualization and routing. Each dataset has a name, star count, distance range, and optional notes.
- **Data Workbench**: An advanced tool for querying online astronomical sources (Gaia, SIMBAD, VizieR) and enriching existing data. Not used for regular dataset imports.

## E

- **Exoplanet**: A planet orbiting a star other than the Sun. TRIPS can display known exoplanets in the Solar System view.

## G

- **Gaia**: European Space Agency mission that has cataloged over a billion stars with precise positions and distances. Gaia DR2 and DR3 data can be used with TRIPS.

## H

- **H2 Database**: Embedded local database used by TRIPS to store star data, datasets, routes, and preferences.
- **Habitable Zone**: The region around a star where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface. Displayed as a translucent ring in the Solar System view.

## I

- **Interstellar View**: The main 3D visualization showing stars in space, with Sol at the center. Stars are displayed with vertical stems indicating their position above or below the reference grid.

## L

- **Light Year (ly)**: The distance light travels in one year, approximately 5.88 trillion miles or 9.46 trillion kilometers. The primary unit of distance in TRIPS.
- **LOD (Level of Detail)**: Rendering technique that adjusts visual detail based on distance from the camera.

## P

- **Plot Stars**: The action of displaying stars from the current dataset in the 3D Interstellar view. Accessed via the **Plot Stars** button in the toolbar.
- **Polity**: A political entity or civilization associated with a star system. Used for science fiction world-building.

## R

- **Route**: A path between two or more star systems, calculated based on transit distances. Used for planning interstellar travel.
- **Routing State**: Shown in the status bar, indicates whether route planning is active or inactive.

## S

- **Side Panel**: The collapsible panel on the right side of the main window containing accordion sections for datasets, objects in view, stellar properties, and routing controls.
- **SIMBAD**: Astronomical database operated by the Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS). Can be queried via the Data Workbench.
- **Sol**: The Sun, Earth's star. Located at the origin (0, 0, 0) in TRIPS coordinates.
- **Solar System View**: A detailed view of an individual star system showing the central star, planets, orbits, and habitable zone.
- **Spectral Class**: A classification of stars based on their temperature and color (O, B, A, F, G, K, M from hottest to coolest). Determines star color in the visualization.
- **Stem**: The vertical line connecting a star to the reference grid in the Interstellar view, showing the star's position above or below the galactic plane.

## T

- **Transit**: A possible jump or connection between two star systems, typically limited by a maximum distance. Used for route planning.
- **TRIPS**: Terran Republic Interstellar Plotting System. The name of this application.

## V

- **VizieR**: Astronomical catalog service providing access to thousands of catalogs. Can be queried via the Data Workbench.
